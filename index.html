            <h3 class="lb_heading">Jerry Seinfeld</h3>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Jerry grew up in New York with his parents Morty and Helen, who have since retired and moved to Florida. (Because when you get to a certain age, hey, it’s basically the law.) Like most things in his life, Jerry’s childhood was perfectly satisfactory. His mom especially dotes on him, frequently wondering aloud how anyone could not like her Jerry. 
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                He likes keeping everything neat and clean, eating cereal, and coining catchphrases. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. 
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                He is perpetually single. Jerry has no problem attracting women, but he tends to discard them for the most minor of alleged flaws. Whether her hands are too big (“man hands”), she eats her peas one at a time, she once dated his archrival Newman, she never laughs, she has a strange-sounding laugh, she refuses to try a piece of pie, or simply that she’s “too good,” Jerry can find a reason to break up with even the most seemingly perfect woman.
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Jerry floats through life making witty observations from a distance while trying not to get too involved, but he’s generally the master of his domain. When someone suggests that one of these days something terrible is going to happen to him, like it does to virtually everyone else on Earth at some point, Jerry calmly replies, “No, I’m going to be just fine.” And you know what? He’s probably right.

        <article>
            <h3 class="lb_heading">Elaine Benes</h3>

            <p class="lb_text">
                 Elaine lives in Manhattan, where she’s basically one of the guys. She spends much of her free time with her closest friend Jerry Seinfeld, whom she used to date, and Jerry’s friends George Costanza and Kramer. Elaine doesn’t really have any close female friends. Maybe women are less tolerant of being physically pushed out of the room after telling Elaine something surprising, which she is wont to do. 
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                She likes eating big salads, dancing (albeit terribly), carrying on feuds, and watching quality films. Just please don’t bring up “The English Patient” because she can’t stand that movie. 
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Elaine has no problem attracting eligible suitors including a former baseball star and the president of NBC, but her screening system for who’s truly “sponge-worthy” needs serious work. Take the time her date is stabbed with a fork by his ex-girlfriend while they sit in a restaurant. Rather than repel Elaine, the fact the guy was “stab-worthy” only made her more intrigued: “There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion.” 
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Given her privileged background, intelligence and good looks, Elaine expects a lot out of life, both professionally and personally. It would be hard for anyone to reach the bar she sets for herself, and usually she doesn’t. Elaine knows what she wants and goes after it with gusto. If she doesn’t get it, though, watch out for that temper.

        <article>
            <h3 class="lb_heading">Cosmo Kramer</h3>

            <p class="lb_text">
                 His details are very sketchy. Here’s what we can tell you: Kramer has long been estranged from his mother “Babs” Kramer, we don’t know anything about his father, he grew up in a strict household where he had to be in bed at 9 p.m. every night, he never finished high school and he ran away at age 17. That’s it. At this point, nobody even knows his first name. 
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                He lives in a Manhattan apartment across the hall from his good friend Jerry Seinfeld, though he probably spends more time in Jerry’s place than his own. Everything’s better at Jerry’s apartment, from the food to the stereo to the sports equipment.  
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Kramer almost never has a real job, yet mysteriously he doesn’t seem to lack for money. This might be because of a shadowy inheritance, or because some of his harebrained get-rich-quick schemes actually pay off. Like his coffee table book on coffee tables that he managed to sell to a legitimate publisher, or the $18,000 he won betting on a single horse race, or creating a cologne that smells like the beach to lead to a modeling job for Calvin Klein. 
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                He is big-hearted, optimistic, and quirky. Few would do more for their friends than the ever-loyal Kramer, but on the other hand few are more likely to get their friends enmeshed in some ill-fated scheme. Still, things are just more interesting when Kramer is around.

        <article>
            <h3 class="lb_heading">George Costanza</h3>

            <p class="lb_text">
                 He grew up in New York with his forever-bickering parents Frank and Estelle. Estelle never thought George would amount to anything, not like his neighbor Lloyd Braun, while Frank’s annual Christmas (OK, “Festivus”) gift to his son was a wrestling match that invariably ended with little Georgie getting pinned. As George’s best friend Jerry Seinfeld once put it, maybe if George’s parents had gotten divorced thirty years ago, he could’ve been completely normal. But alas they’re still together, and still driving George crazy.
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                It’s not easy to find a decent apartment in New York, especially with an iffy job situation, but George is getting by for now. He spends more time at Jerry’s apartment anyway, or at Monk’s coffee shop with Jerry and their other friends Kramer and Elaine Benes. 
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                George’s greatest professional strength is getting fired, a feat he’s managed for reasons ranging from sleeping with the cleaning lady on his desk to faking a handicap. Yet even that undeniable talent failed him the one time he actually wanted to get fired, by the New York Yankees, so he could take a better job with the crosstown Mets. 
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                George is a classic self-saboteur. In fact he (briefly) achieves his greatest success when he realizes that since every decision he has ever made has been wrong, that he should instead do the exact opposite of whatever his instinct tells him to do, in every situation. It's a stroke of rare brilliance, but unfortunately it doesn't last.
